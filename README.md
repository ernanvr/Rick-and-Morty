This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

I created this project to put into practice my recent adquired web development skills.
## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.


Technologies used: Next.js, React.js, Typescript and Sass.
For Media Queries I used [include-media](https://eduardoboucas.github.io/include-media/).
